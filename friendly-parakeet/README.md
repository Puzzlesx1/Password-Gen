# Password Generator

This challenge tasked me with building out Javascript code to randomly generate a password based on 5 pieces of criteria; length, uppercase character, lowercase character, numbers and symbols. 

This helped me piece together multiple Javascript functions that used randomness and user inputted information. It is truly the first step to fully understanding user inputted data and utilizing that to run the site. 

Some challenges I faced was individually listing the string of characters to be selected based on each variable. While this was a tedious step I tried to initially bypass this, by producing functions that would randomly select characters from character code. While I was unable to get this solution to work, I hope I will be able to further learn and understand Javascript.
